## Hi, Iâ€™m Henry Saint-Juste

A Solutions Architect, entrepreneur, and lifelong learner passionate about building scalable cloud systems and meaningful digital experiences. 
By day, I partner with engineering, design, and business teams at NetJets to design AWS-based architectures, modernize platforms, and guide technical strategy.
I also run OneUppDev, my consultancy focused on universal app development (React Native + Web with Expo), iOS development (Swift + SwiftUI), serverless backends on AWS, 
and design systems that unify user experiences across platforms.

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m deeply committed to community. I mentor students, support STEM programs, and host Degree Optional, a podcast that helps people break into tech without a traditional path. 
I also speak at conferences like ColumbusJS, CodeMash, and StirTrek on topics ranging from databases to cross-platform development.
